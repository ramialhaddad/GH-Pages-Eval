# sql server

The project uses EF Core, and has been tested to work with SQL server, running locally. 

1. I usually start by deleting any older databases and keep the server with no databases.
1. I keep SQL Management Studio running so I can verify manually that tables and rows are being updated as expected. 
1. I usually run 'update-database' for each project/database combo via package manager console, even thought automatica updating is turned on in the example project
1. Remember to have all projects set to 'start' with 'Multiple Startup Projects' option before running update-database
